## Introduction

Two major contributions of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are:
  1. A continuously working digital currency system
  2. A model for autonomous decentralized application technology called the blockchain.

Around 2008 & 2009, when the institutions and markets we trusted went crumbling down, and everybody was running away from the Wall Street, a mysterious person, or persons, called Satoshi Nakamoto, introduced a new digital currency, a cryptocurrency called **Bitcoin**. 

| *Bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority.* |

## The Blockchain

But... With no central authority, how did Bitcoin realize trust and security? By implementing software programs for validation, verification, consensus in a novel infrastructure called the **blockchain**. 
Later on in about 2012 & 2013, computation elements were added to the blockchain infrastructure that has opened up a whole world of possibilities beyond simple currency transfer.

| Blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network (transfer of digital assets without any intermediaries), establishing trust among unknown peers and recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger. |

Later on in about 2012 & 2013, computation elements were added to the blockchain infrastructure that has opened up a whole world of possibilities beyond simple currency transfer. The blockchain by itself has taken a life of its own and permeated a broad range of applications across many industries, including finance, healthcare, government, manufacturing, and distribution. 


## What is a decentralized network?

Consider a scenario where a customer wants to buy an item using his credit card. The intermediaries involved in accomplishing this task will be: 
- A credit card agency
- The customer's bank
- A credit card bank
- An exchange
- The merchant's bank
- The merchant

This is an example of a **centralized network** that we are all used to.
A **Decentralized network** a system where peers can transact directly with each other irrespective of where they are located. Functions of the intermediaries are shifted to the periphery to the peer participant in the blockchain infrastructure. Peers are not necessarily known to each other. 

Now, how do we establish trust among the peers in such a decentralized system?
