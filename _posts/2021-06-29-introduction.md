## Introduction

Two major contributions of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are:
  1. A continuously working digital currency system
  2. A model for autonomous decentralized application technology called the blockchain.

Around 2008 & 2009, when the institutions and markets we trusted went crumbling down, and everybody was running away from the Wall Street, a mysterious person, or persons, called Satoshi Nakamoto, introduced a new digital currency, a cryptocurrency called **Bitcoin**. 

| *Bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority.* |

But... With no central authority, how did Bitcoin realize trust and security? By implementing software programs for validation, verification, consensus in a novel infrastructure called the **blockchain**. Blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network, establishing trust among unknown peers and recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger.
