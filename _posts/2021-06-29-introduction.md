## Introduction

Two major contributions of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are:
  1. A continuously working digital currency system
  2. A model for autonomous decentralized application technology called the blockchain.

Around 2008 & 2009, when the institutions and markets we trusted went crumbling down, and everybody was running away from the Wall Street, a mysterious person, or persons, called Satoshi Nakamoto, introduced a new digital currency, a cryptocurrency called **Bitcoin**. 

| *Bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority* |

## The Blockchain

But... With no central authority, how did Bitcoin realize trust and security? By implementing software programs for validation, verification, consensus in a novel infrastructure called the **blockchain**. 
Later on in about 2012 & 2013, computation elements were added to the blockchain infrastructure that has opened up a whole world of possibilities beyond simple currency transfer.

| *Blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network (transfer of digital assets without any intermediaries), establishing trust among unknown peers (a collective trust model) and recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger* |

The blockchain by itself has taken a life of its own and permeated a broad range of applications across many industries, including finance, healthcare, government, manufacturing, and distribution. 


## What is a decentralized network?

Consider a scenario where a customer wants to buy an item using his credit card. The intermediaries involved in accomplishing this task will be: 
- A credit card agency
- The customer's bank
- A credit card bank
- An exchange
- The merchant's bank
- The merchant

This is an example of a **centralized network** that we are all used to.
A **decentralized network** is a system where peers can transact directly with each other irrespective of where they are located. Functions of the intermediaries are shifted to the periphery to the peer participant in the blockchain infrastructure. Peers are not necessarily known to each other.

Now, how do we establish trust among the peers in such a decentralized system? By having a process in place to validate, verify, and confirm transactions. Record the transaction in a distributed ledger of blocks, create a tamper-proof record of blocks (chain of blocks) and implement a consensus protocol for agreement on the block to be added to the chain.

| *Validation, verification, consensus, and immutable recording lead to the trust and security of the blockchain* |

Let's see this in action: David leds Amy $10,000 (this is one single peer to peer transaction) and both make a note of it in a ledger (book). But, David is a cheater and he writes in his ledger that he lent Amy $12,000. Alternatively, Amy also changes her note from $10,000 to $1,000. So where is the trust?

To prevent this trust violation, we need to seek the help of people around, for example, Lisa, Allison, and Francis, providing all of them a valid copy of this ledger. This is the basic concept of an **immutable distributed ledger** defined in a blockchain process. 

In this scenario, they were all physically present in one location. Now imagine this to be an online transaction to an unknown peer. Also, scale up the one transaction to 10,000 transactions or about a million transactions. You should be able to transact with equal ease to any unknown peer in Australia, India or Albania. 
This is the tenet/principle of a decentralized system supported by blockchain. 

In the case just described, how do we trust our unknown peers? Through **verification and validation**. Amy requests Kevin to verify the amount David transacted with her. Kevin checks it and... oops, Kevin finds the amount of the transaction is not $10,000, but $300, so it's not valid. Kevin rejects and nullifies the transaction.

Similar to these, validation, then verification methods devised by the blockchain and implemented by the peers provide the collector trust needed in a decentralized system.
